<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>1..a</p>
<p>This Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) summarises the state of knowledge of climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, technical and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCCâs Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014.</p>
<p>1..b</p>
<p>The assessment is undertaken within the context of the evolving international landscape, in particular, developments in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, including the outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the Paris Agreement. It reflects the increasing diversity of those involved in climate action.</p>
<p>1..c</p>
<p>This report integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports<sub>1</sub>and the three AR6 Special Reports<sub>2</sub>. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and resilient development pathways<sub>3</sub>. Different regional classification schemes<sub>4</sub>are used for physical, social and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature.</p>
<p>1..d</p>
<p>After this introduction, Section 2, â <em>Current Status and Trends</em> â, opens with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options. Section 3, â <em>Long-Term Climate and Development Futures</em> â, provides a long-term assessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic futures. It considers long-term characteristics, impacts, risks and costs in adaptation and mitigation pathways in the context of sustainable development. Section 4, â <em>Near- Term Responses in a Changing Climate</em> â, assesses opportunities for scaling up effective action in the period up to 2040, in the context of climate pledges, and commitments, and the pursuit of sustainable development.</p>
<p>1..e</p>
<p>Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence using the IPCC calibrated language<sub>5</sub>. The scientific findings are drawn from the underlying reports and arise from their Summary for Policymakers (hereafter SPM), Technical Summary (hereafter TS), and underlying chapters and are indicated by {} brackets. Figure 1.1 shows the Synthesis Report Figures Key, a guide to visual icons that are used across multiple figures within this report.</p>
<p>1..f<sub>1</sub>The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, respectively. Their assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September 2021 and 11 October 2021.<sub>2</sub>The three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5Â°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019.<sub>3</sub>The Glossary (Annex I) includes definitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint Working Group Glossary.<sub>4</sub>Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities. A new set of standard AR6 WGI reference land and ocean regions have been defined {1.4.5, 10.1, 11.9, 12.1â12.4, Atlas.1.3.3â1.3.4}. WGIII allocates countries to geographical regions, based on the UN Statistics Division Classification</p>
<p>Annex II WG III</p>

<p>2.1.a <strong>Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1Â°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010-2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals (<em>high confidence</em>). Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages<sub>6</sub>to nature and people (<em>high confidence</em>). Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong></p>

<p>Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences ( <em>high confidence</em> ). In 2019, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>concentrations reached 410 parts per million (ppm), CH<sub>4</sub>reached 1866 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) reached 332 ppb<sub>11</sub>. Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800,000 years ( <em>very high confidence</em> ), and there is <em>high confidence</em> that current CO<sub>2</sub>concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, increases in CO<sub>2</sub>(47%) and CH<sub>4</sub>(156%) concentrations far exceed â and increases in N<sub>2</sub>O (23%) are similar to â the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800,000</p>

<p>2.1.2.a <strong>It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred (Table 2.1).</strong> The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is <em>very likely</em> that GHG emissions were the main driver<sub>17</sub>of tropospheric warming and <em>extremely likely</em> that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is <em>virtually certain</em> that the global upper ocean (0-700m) has warmed since the 1970s and <em>extremely likely</em> that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15â0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to â4.2] mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018 ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 (Figure 3.4). Human influence is <em>very likely</em> the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979 <strong>â</strong> 1988 and 2010 <strong>â</strong> 2019. Human influence has also <em>very likely</em> contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is <em>virtually certain</em> that human-caused CO<sub>2</sub>emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean.</p>

<p>2.1.2.c <strong>Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5 (Figure 2.3).</strong> It is <em>virtually certain</em> that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s (Figure 2.3), while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with <em>high confidence</em> that human-caused climate change is the main driver of these changes. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s <em>(high confidence)</em> , and human influence has <em>very likely</em> contributed to most of them since at least 2006. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis ( <em>high confidence</em> ), and human-caused climate change is <em>likely</em> the main driver (Figure 2.3). Human-caused climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration ( <em>medium confidence</em> ) (Figure 2.3). It is <em>likely</em> that the global proportion of major (Category 3â5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades.</p>

<p>2.1.2.d <strong>Figure 2.3: Both vulnerability to current climate extremes and historical contribution to climate change are highly heterogeneous with many of those who have least contributed to climate change to date being most vulnerable to its impacts. Panel (a)</strong> The IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions are displayed as hexagons with identical size in their approximate geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a whole and for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made on different time scales or more local spatial scales might differ from what is shown in the figure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on observed changes. Striped hexagons (white and light-grey) are used where there is <em>low agreement</em> in the type of change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when there is limited data and/or literature that prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least <em>medium confidence</em> in the observed change. The confidence level for the human influence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend detection and attribution and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for <em>high confidence</em> , two dots for <em>medium confidence</em> and one dot for <em>low confidence</em> (single, filled dot: <em>limited agreement</em> ; single, empty dot: <em>limited evidence</em> ). For hot extremes, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum temperatures; regional studies using other indices (heatwave duration, frequency and intensity) are used in addition. For heavy precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts changes in total column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. <strong>Panel (b)</strong> shows the average level of vulnerability amongst a countryâs population against 2019 CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI emissions per- capita per country for the 180 countries for which both sets of metrics are available. Vulnerability information is based on two global indicator systems, namely INFORM and World Risk Index. Countries with a relatively low average vulnerability often have groups with high vulnerability within their population and vice versa. The underlying data includes, for example, information on poverty, inequality, health care infrastructure or insurance coverage. <strong>Panel (c)</strong> Observed impacts on ecosystems and human systems attributed to climate change at global and regional scales. Global assessments focus on large studies, multi-species, meta-analyses and large reviews. Regional assessments consider evidence on impacts across an entire region and do not focus on any country in particular. For human systems, the direction of impacts is assessed and both adverse and positive impacts have been observed e.g., adverse impacts in one area or food item may occur with positive impacts in another area or food item (for more details and methodology see WGII SMTS.1). Physical water availability includes balance of water available from various sources including ground water, water quality and demand for water. Global mental health and displacement assessments reflect only assessed regions. Confidence levels reflect the assessment of attribution of the observed impact to climate change.</p>

<p>2.1.2.e <strong>Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible<sub>19</sub>losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric and coastal and open ocean ecosystems (<em>high confidence</em>). The extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated in previous assessments (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to higher elevations ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Biological responses including changes in geographic placement and shifting seasonal timing are often not sufficient to cope with recent climate change ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes ( <em>high confidence</em> ) and mass mortality events on land and in the ocean ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain ( <em>medium confidence</em> ) and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Impacts in ecosystems from slow-onset processes such as ocean acidification, sea level rise or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to human-caused climate change ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Climate change has contributed to desertification and exacerbated land degradation, particularly in low lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>2.1.2.f <strong>Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, reduction and loss of cryospheric elements, and greater frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, thereby hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong> . Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has slowed this growth in agricultural productivity over the past 50 years globally <em>(medium confidence</em> ), with related negative crop yield impacts mainly recorded in mid- and low latitude regions, and some positive impacts in some high latitude regions ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Ocean warming in the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in maximum catch potential <em>(medium confidence</em> ), compounding the impacts from overfishing for some fish stocks ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

Current levels of global warming are associated with moderate risks from increased dryland water scarcity ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

<p>2.1.2.n <strong>Across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and systems have been disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> LDCs and SIDS who have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq, 4.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq) excluding CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF, also have high vulnerability to climatic hazards, with global hotspots of high human vulnerability observed in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, SIDS and the Arctic ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods (e.g., smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fishing communities) ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Vulnerability at different spatial levels is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof ( <em>high confidence</em> ), especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability ( <em>high confidence</em> ). In the Arctic and in some high mountain regions, negative impacts of cryosphere change have been especially felt among Indigenous Peoples ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions ( <em>very high confidence</em> ), driven by patterns of intersecting socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalisation, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance<sub>24</sub>( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>Practical experience has informed economic instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, alignment with distributional goals, and social acceptance ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Low-emission technological innovation is strengthened through the combination of technology-push policies, together with policies that create incentives for behaviour change and market opportunities ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (Section 4.8.3). Comprehensive and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective than single policies ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Combining mitigation with policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy can create health co-benefits from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the context to mobilise finance <em>(medium confidence)</em> . These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national context ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Effective and equitable climate governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local communities ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>2.2.2.c <strong>The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently since 2010 (Figure 2.4). Design and process innovations in combination with the use of digital technologies have led to near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions options in buildings, transport and industry.</strong> From 2010 to 2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy (by 85%), wind energy (by 55%), and lithium-ion batteries (by 85%), and large increases in their deployment, e.g., &gt;10Ã for solar and &gt;100Ã for electric vehicles (EVs), albeit varying widely across regions (Figure 2.4). Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems. ( <em>high confidence</em> )</p>

<p>Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority (~60%) of all documented<sub>26</sub>adaptation ( <em>high confidence</em> ). A large number of these adaptation responses are in the agriculture sector and these include on-farm water management, water storage, soil moisture conservation, and irrigation. Other adaptations in agriculture include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and farm and landscape diversification among others ( <em>high confidence</em> ). For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, and land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can reduce flood risk ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Some land-related adaptation actions such as sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have mitigation co-benefits ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Adaptation actions that increase the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions can allow species to persist ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Most innovations in urban adaptation have occurred through advances in disaster risk management, social safety nets and green/blue infrastructure ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Many adaptation measures that benefit health and wellbeing are found in other sectors (e.g., food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation, infrastructure) ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>2.3.2.a <strong>Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> While progress in adaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions ( <em>very high confidence</em> ), many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation<sub>42</sub>( <em>high confidence</em> ). Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than implementation ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Further, observed adaptation is unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps exist among lower population income groups ( <em>high confidence</em> ). In the urban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex risks, for example in the foodâenergyâwaterâhealth nexus or the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation efforts are not expected to meet existing goals ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation ( <em>high confidence</em> ). The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Nevertheless, average annual modelled investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2Â°C or 1.5Â°C are a factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) would need to increase across all sectors and regions ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).

<p>Current global financial flows for adaptation including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries ( <em>high confidence</em> ). There are widening disparities between the estimated costs of adaptation and the documented finance allocated to adaptation ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Adaptation finance needs are estimated to be higher than those assessed in AR5, and the enhanced mobilisation of and access to financial resources are essential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation gaps ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Annual finance flows targeting adaptation for Africa, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

<p>Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5Â°C than at present (1.1Â°C) but lower than at 2Â°C ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (see Section 2.1.2) <strong>.</strong> Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5Â°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3â14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will <em>likely</em> face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5Â°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70â90% at 1.5Â°C of global warming ( <em>high confidence</em> ). At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

<p>At 2Â°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts (RFC3), global aggregate impacts (RFC4) and large-scale singular events (RFC5) would be transitioning to high ( <em>medium confidence</em> ), those associated with extreme weather events (RFC2) would be transitioning to very high ( <em>medium confidence</em> ), and those associated with unique and threatened systems (RFC1) would be very high ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (Figure 3.3, panel a). With about 2Â°C warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens (under low vulnerability and low warming) to hundreds of millions of people (under high vulnerability and high warming), particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America ( <em>high confidence</em> ). For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid- and long-term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>WGII Figure SPM.3</p>
<p>. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and have high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme weather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, exposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused by global warming, such as ice sheet instability or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods include a structured expert elicitation based on the literature described in WGII SM16.6 and are identical to AR5 but are enhanced by a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6.

<p>At global warming of 3Â°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits (see Section 3.2) ( <em>high confidence</em> ). For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5Â°C to 3Â°C ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4â2 times at 2Â°C and 2.5â3.9 times at 3Â°C, compared to 1.5Â°C global warming without adaptation ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>3.1.3.b <strong>Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong> .

The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100 ( <em>high confidence</em> ). At sustained warming levels between 2Â°C and 3Â°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia ( <em>limited evidence</em> ).

<p>3.1.3.c <strong>The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong> . Warming substantially above the assessed <em>very likely</em> range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is <em>high confidence</em> this would lead to regional changes greater than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming within the <em>very likely</em> assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the <em>likely</em> range â approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) ( <em>low confidence</em> ) â cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes<sub>66</sub>and would have severe impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global warming increases, some compound extreme events<sub>67</sub>will become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent ( <em>high confidence</em> ). The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is <em>very likely</em> to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios ( <em>high confidence</em> ), however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). If such a low probability event were to occur, it would <em>very likely</em> cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades</p>

The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing warming ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5Â°Câ2Â°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming <em>(high confidence</em> ). Globally, adaptation options related to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3Â°C, with a substantial increase in residual risk ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>3.3.2.a <strong>From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions (see Cross-Section Box 1).

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to achieve net-negative CO2 emissions<sub>78</sub>. Achieving global net zero CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>emissions balanced by durably stored CO<sub>2</sub>from anthropogenic removal<sub>,</sub>is a requirement to stabilise CO<sub>2</sub>-induced global surface temperature increase (see 3.3.3) ( <em>high confidence</em> ). This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions (see Cross- Section Box 1) equal CO<sub>2</sub>removal ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net-negative CO<sub>2</sub>emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

<p>3.3.3.c <strong>In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO<sub>2</sub>or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing âhard-to-abateâ residual emissions (e.g., some emissions from agriculture, aviation, shipping, industrial processes) to help reach net zero CO<sub>2</sub>or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO<sub>2</sub>or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co- benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity (e.g., ocean alkalinisation) to higher maturity (e.g., reforestation); removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential (&lt;1 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>/yr, e.g., blue carbon management) to higher potential (&gt;3 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>/yr, e.g., agroforestry); costs range from lower cost (e.g., â45 to 100 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub>for soil carbon sequestration) to higher cost (e.g., 100â300 USD/tCO<sub>2</sub>for direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage) ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).

<p>3.3.3.d<sub>79</sub>CCS is an option to reduce emissions from large-scale fossil-based energy and industry sources provided geological storage is available. When CO2 is captured directly from the atmosphere (DACCS), or from biomass (BECCS), CCS provides the storage component of these CDR methods. CO2 capture and subsurface injection is a mature technology for gas processing and enhanced oil recovery. In contrast to the oil and gas sector, CCS is less mature in the power sector, as well as in cement and chemicals production, where it is a critical mitigation option. The technical geological storage capacity is estimated to be on the order of 1000 GtCO2, which is more than the CO2 storage requirements through 2100 to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C, although the regional availability of geological storage could be a limiting factor. If the geological storage site is appropriately selected and managed, it is estimated that the CO2 can be permanently isolated from the atmosphere. Implementation of CCS currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological environmental and socio-cultural barriers. Currently, global rates of CCS deployment are far below those in modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C to 2Â°C. Enabling conditions such as policy instruments, greater public support</p>
<p>3.3.3.e <strong>Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO<sub>2</sub>emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5Â°C (&gt;50%) without overshoot.</p>

<p>4.1.a <strong>Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation reduces the risks of climate change for humans and ecosystems. In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2Â°C (&gt;67%) and assume immediate action, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep reductions<em>.</em>As adaptation options often have long implementation times, accelerated implementation of adaptation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps. (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong></p>
<p>4.1.b <strong>The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions (<em>very high confidence</em>).</strong> Global warming is <em>more likely than not</em> to reach 1.5Â°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9), and <em>likely</em> or <em>very likely</em> to exceed 1.5Â°C under higher emissions scenarios<sub>84</sub>. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5Â°C ( <em>medium to high confidence</em> , depending on option), but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5Â°C global warming is exceeded in the near-term ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>4.2.a <strong>Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations. Deep, rapid and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by a range of enabling conditions and removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility.<em>(high confidence)</em></strong></p>
<p>4.2.b <strong>Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring benefits to human well-being (<em>high confidence</em>) (Section 4.3).</strong> As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain for some regions. The benefits to vulnerable populations would be high (see Section 4.4). ( <em>high confidence)</em> <strong>{</strong> WGI SPM B.1, WGI SPM B.1.3, WGI SPM B.2.2, WGI SPM B.3; WGII SPM C.1.1, WGII SPM C.1.2, WGII SPM C.2, WGII SPM C.3.1, WGII SPM Figure SPM.4b; SROCC SPM C.3.4, SROCC Figure 3.4, SROCC SPM Figure 5}</p>
<p>4.2.c <strong>Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5Â°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all (<em>very high confidence</em>).</strong> The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on ecosystems ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses integrating adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, as well as in meeting requirements for financing ( <em>very high confidence</em> ) (see Section 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9)</p>

<p>4.2.d <strong>Mitigation actions will have other sustainable development co-benefits (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> Mitigation will improve air quality and human health in the near-term notably because many air pollutants are co-emitted by GHG emitting sectors and because methane emissions leads to surface ozone formation ( <em>high confidence</em> ) The benefits from air quality improvement include prevention of air pollution-related premature deaths, chronic diseases and damages to ecosystems and crops. The economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). As methane has a short lifetime but is a potent GHG, strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>4.2.h <strong>Barriers to feasibility would need to be reduced or removed to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale.</strong> Many limits to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome by addressing a range of barriers, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical.

Diverging pathways illustrate that interacting choices and actions made by diverse government, private sector and civil society actors can advance climate resilient development, shift pathways towards sustainability, and enable lower emissions and adaptation. Diverse knowledges and values include cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge. Climatic and non-climatic events, such as droughts, floods or pandemics, pose more severe shocks to pathways with lower climate resilient development (red to yellow) than to pathways with higher climate resilient development (green). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5Â°C, and with every increment of warming, losses and damages will increase. The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic development impact GHG emissions and hence shape mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries and regions. Pathways and opportunities for action are shaped by previous actions (or inactions and opportunities missed, dashed pathway), and enabling and constraining conditions (left panel), and take place in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. The longer emissions reductions are delayed, the fewer effective adaptation options.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="near-term-risks"><strong>4.3 Near-Term Risks</strong></h2>
<p>4.3.a <strong>Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming (<em>high confidence</em>). Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage (<em>high confidence</em>). Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming (<em>very high confidence</em>), while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations (<em>high confidence</em>). Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong></p>
<p>4.3.b <strong>Global warming will continue to increase in the near term (2021â2040) mainly due to increased cumulative CO<sub>2</sub>emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards (<em>medium to high confidenc</em>e, depending on region and hazard), increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans (<em>very high confidence</em>)<em>.</em></strong> In the near-term, natural variability<sub>92</sub>will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5oC relative to 1850â1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI (medium confidence). The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near-term<sub>93</sub>, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>4.3.c <strong>The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> In the near-term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systemsâ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Urbanisation increases hot extremes ( <em>very high confidence</em> ) and precipitation runoff intensity ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (Figure 4.3). Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (see Figure 3.4 and Figure 4.3). Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and</p>

<p>4.4.f <strong>Many economic and regulatory instruments have been effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).

Behaviour and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being ( <em>high confidence</em> ).

<p>Considering climate change impacts and risks (e.g., through climate services) in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, low-emission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials.

<p>4.5.4.a <strong>There is substantial mitigation and adaptation potential from options in agriculture, forestry and other land use, and in the oceans, that could be upscaled in the near term across most regions (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong> (Figure 4.5). Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs required integrated approaches to meet multiple objectives including food security. Demand-side measures (shifting to sustainable healthy diets and reducing food loss/waste) and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion and CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agriculture and forest products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. The effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation and most water-related adaptation options declines with increasing warming (see 3.2). ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

<p>4.8.1.b <strong>Both adaptation and mitigation finance need to increase many-fold, to address rising climate risks and to accelerate investments in emissions reduction (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> Increased finance would address soft limits to adaptation and rising climate risks while also averting some related losses and damages, particularly in vulnerable developing countries ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Enhanced mobilisation of and access to finance, together with building capacity, are essential for implementation of adaptation actions and to reduce adaptation gaps given rising risks and costs, especially for the most vulnerable groups, regions and sectors ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Public finance is an important enabler of adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Adaptation funding predominately comes from public sources, and public mechanisms and finance can leverage private sector finance by addressing real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for instance via public-private partnerships ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Financial and technological resources enable effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation, especially when supported by institutions with a strong understanding of adaptation needs and capacity ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Average annual modelled mitigation investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2Â°C or 1.5Â°C are a factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments (public, private, domestic and international) would need to increase across all sectors and regions ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).

Scaled-up public grants for mitigation and adaptation funding for vulnerable regions, e.g., in Sub-Saharan Africa, would be cost-effective and have high social returns in terms of access to basic energy. Options for scaling up mitigation and adaptation in developing regions include: increased levels of public finance and publicly mobilised private finance flows from developed to developing countries in the context of the USD 100 billion-a-year goal of the Paris Agreement; increase the use of public guarantees to reduce risks and leverage private flows at lower cost; local capital markets development; and building greater trust in international cooperation processes. A coordinated effort to make the post-pandemic recovery sustainable over the long term through increased flows of financing over this decade can accelerate climate action, including in developing regions facing high debt costs, debt distress and macroeconomic uncertainty.

<p>4.8.2.a <strong>International cooperation is a critical enabler for achieving ambitious climate change mitigation goals and climate resilient development (<em>high confidence</em>)</strong> . Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation including mobilising and enhancing access to finance, particularly for developing countries, vulnerable regions, sectors and groups and aligning finance flows for climate action to be consistent with ambition levels and funding needs ( <em>high confidence</em> ). While agreed processes and goals, such as those in the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, are helping (Section 2.2.1), international financial, technology and capacity building support to developing countries will enable greater implementation and more ambitious actions ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). By integrating equity and climate justice, national and international policies can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability, especially by mobilising and enhancing access to finance for vulnerable regions, sectors and communities ( <em>high confidence</em> ). International cooperation and coordination, including combined policy packages, may be particularly important for sustainability transitions in emissions-intensive and highly traded basic materials industries that are exposed to international competition ( <em>high confidence</em> ). The large majority of emission modelling studies assume significant international cooperation to secure financial flows and address inequality and poverty issues in pathways limiting global warming. There are large variations in the modelled effects of mitigation on GDP across regions, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Delayed global cooperation increases policy costs across regions ( <em>high confidence</em> ).</p>

Multilateral governance efforts can help reconcile contested interests, world views and values about how to address climate change. International environment and sectoral agreements, and initiatives in some cases, may help to stimulate low GHG investment and reduce emissions (such as ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution and atmospheric emissions of mercury). Improvements to national and international governance structures would further enable the decarbonisation of shipping and aviation through deployment of low-emissions fuels, for example through stricter efficiency and carbon intensity standards. Transnational partnerships can also stimulate policy development, low-emissions technology diffusion, emission reductions and adaptation, by linking sub-national and other actors, including cities, regions, non-governmental organisations and private sector entities, and by enhancing interactions between state and non-state actors, though uncertainties remain over their costs, feasibility, and effectiveness.

<p>4.9.c <strong>Approaches that align goals and actions across sectors provide opportunities for multiple and large- scale benefits and avoided damages in the near-term</strong> . <strong>Such measures can also achieve greater benefits through cascading effects across sectors (<em>medium confidence</em>).</strong> For example, the feasibility of using land for both agriculture and centralised solar production can increase when such options are combined ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Similarly, integrated transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations can together reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decarbonising the transport and energy sectors ( <em>high confidence</em> ).The implementation of packages of multiple city-scale mitigation strategies can have cascading effects across sectors and reduce GHG emissions both within and outside a cityâs administrative boundaries <em>(very high confidence</em> ). Integrated design approaches to the construction and retrofit of buildings provide increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings in several regions. To minimise maladaptation, multi-sectoral, multi-actor and inclusive planning with flexible pathways encourages low-regret and timely actions that keep options open, ensure benefits in multiple sectors and systems and suggest the available solution space for adapting to long-term climate change ( <em>very high confidence</em> ). Trade-offs in terms of employment, water use, land-use competition and biodiversity, as well as access to, and the affordability of, energy, food, and water can be avoided by well-implemented land-based mitigation options, especially those that do not threaten existing sustainable land uses and land rights, with frameworks for integrated policy implementation <em>(high confidence)</em> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGII SPM C.2</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGII SPM C.2.1â2.13</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGII SPM C.4.4</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM C.6.3</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM C.6</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM C.7.2</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM C.8.5</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM D.1.2</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM D.1.5</a> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/petermr/semanticClimate/blob/main/ipcc/ar6/wg2/spm/html/fulltext/groups_groups.html#c.2">WGIII SPM E.1.2</a></p>
<p>4.9.d <strong>Mitigation and adaptation when implemented together, and combined with broader sustainable development objectives, would yield multiple benefits for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> The range of such positive interactions is significant in the landscape of near-term climate policies across regions, sectors and systems. For example, AFOLU mitigation actions in land-use change and forestry, when sustainably implemented, can provide large-scale GHG emission reductions and removals that simultaneously benefit biodiversity, food security, wood supply and other ecosystem services but cannot fully compensate for delayed mitigation action in other sectors <em>.</em> Adaptation measures in land, ocean and ecosystems similarly can have widespread benefits for food security, nutrition, health and well-being, ecosystems and biodiversity. Equally, urban systems are critical, interconnected sites for climate resilient development; urban policies that implement multiple interventions can yield adaptation or mitigation gains with equity and human well-being. Integrated policy packages can improve the ability to integrate considerations of equity, gender equality and justice. Coordinated cross-sectoral policies and planning can maximise synergies and avoid or reduce trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation. Effective action in all of the above areas will require near-term political commitment and follow-through, social</p>

<p>increased rapidly over recent decades ( <strong>panel (a)</strong> ). Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions include CO<sub>2</sub>from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI) (dark green); net CO<sub>2</sub>from land use, land-use change and forestry (CO<sub>2</sub>- LULUCF) (green); CH<sub>4</sub>; N<sub>2</sub>O; and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF<sub>6</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>) (light blue). These emissions have led to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of several GHGs including the three major well-mixed GHGs CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O ( <strong>panel (b)</strong> , annual values). To indicate their relative importance each subpanelâs vertical extent for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O is scaled to match the assessed individual direct effect (and, in the case of CH<sub>4</sub>indirect effect via atmospheric chemistry impacts on tropospheric ozone) of historical emissions on temperature change from 1850 <strong>â</strong> 1900 to 2010 <strong>â</strong> 2019. This estimate arises from an assessment of effective radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The global surface temperature (shown as annual anomalies from a 1850 <strong>â</strong> 1900 baseline) has increased by around 1.1Â°C since 1850 <strong>â</strong> 1900 ( <strong>panel (c)</strong> ). The vertical bar on the right shows the estimated temperature ( <em>very likely</em> range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the assessed multi-century temperature range [0.5Â°Câ1.5â] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. Formal detection and attribution studies synthesise information from climate models and observations and show that the best estimate is that all the warming observed between 1850 <strong>â</strong> 1900 and 2010 <strong>â</strong> 2019 is caused by humans ( <strong>panel (d)</strong> ). The panel shows temperature change attributed to: total human influence; its decomposition into changes in GHG concentrations and other human drivers (aerosols, ozone and land-use change (land-use reflectance)); solar and volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show <em>likely</em> ranges.</p>

<p><sub>12</sub>GHG emission metrics are used to express emissions of different GHGs in a common unit. Aggregated GHG emissions in this report are stated in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>-eq) using the Global Warming Potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) with values based on the contribution of Working Group I to the AR6. The AR6 WGI and WGIII reports contain updated emission metric values, evaluations of different metrics with regard to mitigation objectives, and assess new approaches to aggregating gases. The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {WGI SPM D.1.8, WGI 7.6; WGIII</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2.2: Regional GHG emissions, and the regional proportion of total cumulative production-based CO2emissions from 1850 to 2019. Panel (a)</strong> shows the share of historical cumulative net anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>emissions per region from 1850 to 2019 in GtCO<sub>2</sub>. This includes CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI and CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF. Other GHG emissions are not included. CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF emissions are subject to high uncertainties, reflected by a global uncertainty estimate of Â±70% (90% in 2019. GHG emissions are categorised into: CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI; net CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF; and other GHG emissions (CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, fluorinated gases, expressed in CO<sub>2</sub>-eq using GWP100-AR6). The height of each rectangle shows per capita emissions, the width shows the population of the region, so that the area of the rectangles refers to the total emissions for each region. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included. In the case of two regions, the area for CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF is below the axis, indicating net CO<sub>2</sub>removals rather than emissions. <strong>Panel (c)</strong> shows global net anthropogenic GHG emissions by region (in GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq yr<sub>â1</sub>(GWP100-AR6)) for the time period 1990â2019. Percentage values refer to the contribution of each region to total GHG emissions in each respective time period. The single-year peak of emissions in 1997 was due to higher CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF emissions from a forest and peat fire event in South East Asia. Regions are as grouped in Annex II of WGIII. <strong>Panel (d)</strong> shows population, GDP per person, emission indicators by region in 2019 for total GHG per person, and total GHG emissions intensity, together with production-based and consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI data, which is assessed in this report up to 2018. Consumption-based emissions are emissions released to the atmosphere in order to generate the goods and services consumed by a certain entity (e.g., region). Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included.</p>

<p><strong>Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely.</strong> Historical contributions of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI (1650 Â± 73 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq) and net CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF (760 Â± 220 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq) emissions (Figure 2.2). Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq to 19 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq across regions (Figure 2.2). Least developed countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have much lower per capita emissions (1.7 tCO2- eq and 4.6 tCO2-eq, respectively) than the global average (6.9 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq), excluding CO<sub>2</sub>-LULUCF <em>.</em> Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq per capita<sub>13</sub>(excluding CO<sub>2</sub>- LULUCF) while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq per capita.

Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%) but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr<sub>â1</sub>in the transport sector ( <em>high confidence</em> ). About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO<sub>2</sub>LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation <em>(medium confidence</em> ).

<p><strong>Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production.</strong> Emissions reductions in CO<sub>2</sub>from fossil fuels and industrial processes (CO2-FFI), due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34â45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40â53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13â15%. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas (a rise from about 62% to 67 <strong>â</strong> 72% of the global share between 2015 and 2020).

<p><strong>Figure 2.4</strong> : <strong>Unit cost reductions and use in some rapidly changing mitigation technologies.</strong> The <strong>top panel (a)</strong> shows global costs per unit of energy (USD per MWh) for some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. Solid blue lines indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. Yellow shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding to USD55â148 per MWh). In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the three renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts. Further, LCOE does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment. The <strong>bottom panel (b)</strong> shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change over the past decade. The electricity production share reflects different capacity factors; for example, for the same amount of installed capacity, wind produces about twice as examples because they have recently shown rapid changes in costs and adoption, and because consistent data are available. Other mitigation options assessed in the WGIII report are not included as they do not meet these criteria.</p>

<p>Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, complemented by regulatory instruments mainly at the national and also sub-national and regional level ( <em>high confidence</em> ). By 2020, over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Equity and distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support low-income households, among other approaches ( <em>high confidence</em> ). The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&amp;D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale ( <em>high confidence</em> ) (Figure 2.4).</p>

<p><strong>Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade (<em>high confidence</em>).</strong> While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity (total primary energy per unit GDP) decreased by 2% yr<sub>â1</sub>between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon intensity (CO<sub>2</sub>-FFI per unit primary energy) also decreased by 0.3% yr<sub>â1</sub>, mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions ( <em>high confidence</em> ). At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO<sub>2</sub>and GHG and consumption-based CO<sub>2</sub>absolute emission reductions for longer than 10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates of around 4% yr<sub>â1</sub>for several years consecutively ( <em>high confidence</em> ). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq yr<sub>â1</sub>( <em>medium confidence</em> ). At least 1.8 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq yr<sub>â1</sub>of avoided emissions can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). Growing numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and are estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq yr<sub>â1</sub>of avoided emissions in 2016 ( <em>medium confidence</em> ). These reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth ( <em>high confidence</em> )</p>

<p>Modelled scenarios and pathways<sub>45</sub>are used to explore future emissions, climate change, related impacts and risks, and possible mitigation and adaptation strategies and are based on a range of assumptions, including socio-economic variables and mitigation options. These are quantitative projections and are neither predictions nor forecasts. Global modelled emission pathways, including those based on cost effective approaches contain regionally differentiated assumptions and outcomes, and have to be assessed with the careful recognition of these assumptions. Most do not make explicit assumptions about global equity, environmental justice or intra-regional income distribution. IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the scenarios in the</p>
<p><sub>45</sub>In the literature, the terms pathways and scenarios are used interchangeably, with the former more frequently used in relation to climate goals. WGI primarily used the term scenarios and WGIII mostly used the term modelled emissions and mitigation pathways. The SYR primarily uses scenarios when referring to WGI and modelled emissions and mitigation pathways when referring to WGIII.</p>

<p><strong>Socio-economic Development, Scenarios, and Pathways</strong> The five Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP1 to SSP5) were designed to span a range of challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. For the assessment of climate impacts, risk and adaptation, the SSPs are used for future exposure, vulnerability and challenges to adaptation. Depending on levels of GHG mitigation, modelled emissions scenarios based on the SSPs can be consistent with low or high warming levels<sub>47</sub>. There are many different mitigation strategies that could be consistent with different levels of global warming in 2100 (see Figure 4.1).</p>

<p>WGI assessed the climate response to five illustrative scenarios based on SSPs<sub>48</sub>that cover the range of possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. These scenarios combine socio-economic assumptions, levels of climate mitigation, land use and air pollution controls for aerosols and non-CH<sub>4</sub>ozone precursors. The high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) have CO<sub>2</sub>emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively<sub>49</sub>. The intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) has CO<sub>2</sub>emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century. The very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) have CO<sub>2</sub>emissions declining to net zero around 2050 and 2070, respectively, followed by varying levels of net negative CO<sub>2</sub>emissions. In addition, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)<sub>50</sub>were used by WGI and WGII to assess regional climate changes, impacts and risks.</p>
<p>WGI Box SPM.1</p>
<p>(Cross-Section Box.2, Figure 1)</p>
<p>In WGIII, a large number of global modelled emissions pathways were assessed, of which 1202 pathways were categorised based on their projected global warming over the 21st century, with categories ranging from pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C with more than 50% likelihood<sub>51</sub>with no or limited overshoot (C1) to pathways that exceed 4Â°C (C8). Methods to project global warming associated with the modelled pathways were updated to ensure consistency with the AR6 WGI assessment of the climate system response<sub>52</sub>.</p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong> Dynamic interactions between climate-related hazards, exposure and vulnerability of the affected human society, species, or ecosystems result in risks arising from climate change. AR6 assesses key risks across sectors and regions as well as providing an updated assessment of the Reasons for Concern (RFCs) â five globally aggregated categories of risk that evaluate risk accrual with increasing global surface temperature. Risks can also arise from climate change mitigation or adaptation responses when the response does not achieve its intended objective, or when it results in adverse effects for other societal objectives.</p>

<p>* The terminology SSPx-y is used, where âSSPxâ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway or âSSPâ describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenario, and âyâ refers to the approximate level of radiative forcing (in watts per square metre, or W m<sub>â2</sub>) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100. ** The AR5 scenarios (RCPy), which partly inform the AR6 WGI and WGII assessments, are indexed to a similar set of approximate 2100 radiative forcing levels (in Wm<sub>-2</sub>). The SSP scenarios cover a broader range of GHG and air pollutant futures than the RCPs. They are similar but not identical, with differences in concentration trajectories for different GHGs. The overall radiative forcing tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to the RCPs with the same label ( <em>medium confidence</em> ).</p>

WGII provides further assessment of the impacts on human and natural systems using these projections and additional lines of evidence. <strong>(a)</strong> Risks of species losses as indicated by the percentage of assessed species exposed to potentially dangerous temperature conditions, as defined by conditions beyond the estimated historical (1850-2005) maximum mean annual temperature experienced by each species, at GWLs of 1.5Â°C, 2Â°C, 3Â°C and 4Â°C. Underpinning projections of temperature are from 21 Earth system models and do not consider extreme events impacting ecosystems such as the Arctic. <strong>(b)</strong> Risk to human health as indicated by the days per year of population exposure to hypothermic conditions that pose a risk of mortality from surface air temperature and humidity conditions for historical period (1991-2005) and at GWLs of 1.7Â°Câ2.3Â°C (mean = 1.9Â°C; 13 climate models), 2.4Â°Câ3.1Â°C (2.7Â°C; 16 climate models) and 4.2Â°Câ5.4Â°C (4.7Â°C; 15 climate models). Interquartile ranges of WGLs by 2081-2100 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and assessments. <strong>(c)</strong> Impacts on food production: (c1) Changes in maize yield at projected GWLs of 1.6Â°Câ2.4<sub>o</sub>C (2.0Â°C), 3.3Â°Câ4.8<sub>o</sub>C (4.1Â°C) and 3.9Â°Câ6.0<sub>o</sub>C (4.9Â°C). Median yield changes from an ensemble of 12 crop models, each driven by bias-adjusted outputs from 5 Earth system models from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Maps depict 2080â2099 compared to 1986â2005 for current growing regions (&gt;10 ha), with the corresponding range of future global warming levels shown under SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Hatching indicates areas where &lt;70% of the climate-crop model combinations agree on the sign of impact. (c2) Changes in maximum fisheries catch potential by 2081â2099 relative to 1986â2005 at projected GWLs of 0.9Â°Câ2.0Â°C (1.5Â°C) and 3.4Â°Câ5.2Â°C (4.3Â°C). GWLs by 2081â2100 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Hatching indicates where the two climate-fisheries models disagree in the direction of change.

These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity. <em>Very likely</em> ranges are shown for the low and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0); <strong>Right</strong> - Global Reasons for Concern, comparing AR6 (thick embers) and AR5 (thin embers) assessments. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming low to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localised and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.1Â°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future projected risks above it. Lines connect the midpoints of the transition from moderate to high risk across AR5 and AR6. <strong>Panel (b)</strong> : Risks for land-based systems and ocean/coastal ecosystems.

<p>Global mean sea level change in centimetres, relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and <em>likely</em> ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. <strong>Right</strong> - Assessment of the combined risk of coastal flooding, erosion and salinization for four illustrative coastal geographies in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels, under two response scenarios, with respect to the SROCC baseline period (1986â2005) and indicating the IPCC AR6 baseline period (1995â2014). The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes in cyclone intensity). âNo-to-moderate responseâ describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further significant action or new types of actions). âMaximum potential responseâ represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus significant additional efforts compared to today, assuming minimal financial, social and political barriers. The assessment criteria include exposure and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), coastal hazards (flooding, shoreline erosion, salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defences, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers areas, and subsidence management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, may or may not be considered to be adaptation. <strong>Panel (d)</strong> : <strong>Left</strong> - Heat-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole ÂºC within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP scenarios. <strong>Right</strong> - Risks associated with food security due to climate change and patterns of socio-economic development. Risks to food security include availability and access to food, including population at risk of hunger, food price increases and increases in disability adjusted life years attributable to childhood underweight. Risks are assessed for two contrasted socio-economic pathways (SSP1 and SSP3) excluding the effects of targeted mitigation and adaptation policies. <strong>Panel (e)</strong> : Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least <em>medium confidence</em> level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness of the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); likelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.4: Observed and projected global mean sea level change and its impacts, and time scales of coastal risk management. Panel (a)</strong> : Global mean sea level change in metres relative to 1900. The historical changes (black) are observed by tide gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards. The future changes to 2100 and for 2150 (coloured lines and shading) are assessed consistently with observational constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice-sheet, and glacier models, and median values and <em>likely</em> ranges are shown for the considered scenarios. Relative to 1995â2014, the <em>likely</em> global mean sea level rise by 2050 is between 0.15â0.23 m in the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9) and 0.20â 0.29 m in the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5); by 2100 between 0.28â0.55 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.63â 1.01 m under SSP5-8.5; and by 2150 between 0.37â0.86 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.98â1.88 m under SSP5-8.5 ( <em>medium to 1995â2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995â2014. The future changes to 2300 (bars) are based on literature assessment, representing the 17thâ83rd percentile range for SSP1-2.6 (0.3â3.1 m) and SSP5-8.5 (1.7â6.8 m). Red dashed lines: Low-likelihood, high-impact storyline, including ice sheet instability processes. These indicate the potential impact of deeply uncertain processes, and show the 83rd percentile of SSP5-8.5 projections that include low-likelihood, high-impact processes that cannot be ruled out; because of</em> <em>low confidence</em> in projections of these processes, this is not part of a <em>likely</em> range. IPCC AR6 global and regional sea level projections are hosted at https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea- level-projection-tool. The low-lying coastal zoneis currently home to around 896 million people (nearly 11% of the 2020 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050 across all five SSPs. <strong>Panel (b)</strong> : Typical time scales for the planning, implementation (dashed bars) and operational lifetime of current coastal risk-management measures (blue bars). Higher rates of sea level rise demand earlier and stronger responses and reduce the lifetime of measures (inset). As the scale and pace of sea level rise accelerates beyond 2050, long-term adjustments may in some locations be beyond the limits of current adaptation options and for some small islands and low-lying coasts could be an existential risk.</p>

<p><strong>Table 3.1: Key characteristics of the modelled global emissions pathways.</strong> Summary of projected CO<sub>2</sub>and GHG emissions, projected net-zero timings and the resulting global warming outcomes. Pathways are categorised (columns), according to their likelihood of limiting warming to different peak warming levels (if peak temperature occurs before 2100) and 2100 warming levels. Values shown are for the median [p50] and 5thâ95th percentiles [p5âp95], noting that not all pathways achieve net-zero CO<sub>2</sub>or GHGs.</p>
<p>WGIII Table SPM.2</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> Detailed explanations on the Table are provided in WGIII Box SPM.1 and WGIII Table SPM.2. The relationship between the temperature categories and SSP/RCPs is discussed in Cross-Section Box 2. Values in the table refer to the 50th and [5thâ95th] percentile values across the pathways falling within a given category as defined in WGIII Box SPM.1. The three dots (â¦) sign denotes that the value cannot be given (as the value is after 2100 or, for net zero, net-zero is not reached). Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WG I (Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators were used for the probabilistic assessment the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed ranges in the âlikelihoodâ column, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). These ranges cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate emulatorsâ uncertainty. All global warming levels are relative to 1850â1900. <strong>2</strong> C3 pathways are sub-categorised according to the timing of policy action to match the emissions pathways in WGIII Figure SPM.4. <strong>3</strong> Global emission reductions in mitigation pathways are reported on a pathway-by-pathway basis relative to harmonised modelled global emissions in 2019 rather than the global emissions reported in WGIII SPM Section B and WGIII Chapter 2; this ensures internal consistency in assumptions about emission sources and activities, as well as consistency with temperature projections based on the physical climate science assessment by WGI (see WGIII SPM Footnote 49). Negative values (e.g., in C5, C6) represent an increase in emissions. The modelled GHG emissions in 2019 are 55 [53â58] GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq, thus within the uncertainty ranges of estimates for 2019 emissions [53-66] GtCO<sub>2</sub>-eq (see 2.1.1). <strong>4</strong> Emissions milestones are provided for 5-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying 5-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Ranges in square brackets underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile 5-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile 5-year interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach specific milestones over the 21st century. Percentiles reported across all pathways in that category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100. <strong>5</strong> For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO<sub>2</sub>-eq defined by the 100-year global warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate response and the assignment to a climate category. Emissions pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. See WGIII Annex III.II.5. <strong>6</strong> Cumulative emissions are calculated from the start of 2020 to the time of net zero and 2100, respectively. They are based on harmonised net CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, ensuring consistency with the WG I assessment of the remaining carbon budget.</p>

<p><sub>90</sub>The southern part of Mexico is included in the climatic subregion South Central America (SCA) for WGI. Mexico is assessed as part of North America for WGII. The climate change literature for the SCA region occasionally includes Mexico, and in those cases WGII assessment makes reference to Latin America. Mexico is considered part of Latin America and the Caribbean for WGIII. {WGII 12.1.1,</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4.1: Sectoral emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5</strong> Â° <strong>C. Panel (a)</strong> shows sectoral CO<sub>2</sub>and non-CO<sub>2</sub>emissions in global modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5Â°C (&gt;50%) with no or limited overshoot. The horizontal lines illustrate halving 2015 emissions (base year of the pathways) (dashed) and reaching net-zero emissions (solid line). The range shows the 5â95th percentile of the emissions across the pathways. The timing strongly differs by sector, with the CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from the electricity/fossil fuel industries sector and land-use change generally reaching net zero earlier. Non-CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from agriculture are also substantially reduced compared to pathways without climate policy but do not typically reach zero. <strong>Panel (b)</strong> Although all pathways include strongly reduced emissions, there are different pathways as indicated by the illustrative mitigation pathways used in IPCC WGIII. The pathways emphasise routes consistent with limiting warming to 1.5Â°C with a high reliance on net negative emissions (IMP-Neg), high resource efficiency (IMP-LD), a focus on sustainable development (IMP-SP) or renewables (IMP-Ren) and consistent with 2Â°C</p>
<p>Positive (solid filled bars) and negative emissions (hatched bars) for different illustrative mitigation pathways are compared to GHG emissions from the year 2019. The category âenergy supply (including electricity)â includes bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air carbon capture and storage.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4.3: Every region faces more severe or frequent compound and/or cascading climate risks in the near term.</strong> Changes in risk result from changes in the degree of the hazard, the population exposed, and the degree of vulnerability of people, assets, or ecosystems. <strong>Panel (a)</strong> Coastal flooding events affect many of the highly populated regions of the world where large percentages of the population are exposed. The panel shows near-term projected increase of population exposed to 100-year flooding events depicted as the increase from the year 2020 to 2040 (due to sea level rise and migration from coastal areas due to future sea level rise is not considered in the scenario. <strong>Panel (b)</strong> projected median probability in the year 2040 for extreme water levels resulting from a combination of mean sea level rise, tides and storm surges, which have a historical 1% average annual probability. A peak-over-threshold (99.7%) method was applied to the historical tide gauge observations available in the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis version 2 database, which is the same information as WGI Figure 9.32, except here the panel uses relative sea level projections under SSP2-4.5 for the year 2040 instead of 2050 The absence of a circle indicates an inability to perform an assessment due to a lack of data, but does not indicate absence of increasing frequencies. <strong>Panel (c)</strong> Climate hazards can initiate risk cascades that affect multiple sectors and propagate across regions following complex natural and societal connections. This example of a compound heat wave and a drought event striking an agricultural region shows how multiple risks are interconnected and lead to cascading biophysical, economic, and societal impacts even in distant regions, with vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers, children and pregnant women particularly impacted.</p>

<p><sub>94</sub>System transitions involve a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options that enable deep emissions reductions and transformative adaptation in all sectors. This report has a particular focus on the following system transitions: energy; industry; cities, settlements and infrastructure; land, ocean, food and water; health and nutrition; and society, livelihood and economies</p>

<p>options across different systems. The left hand side of panel (a) shows climate responses and adaptation options assessed for their multidimensional feasibility at global scale, in the near term and up to 1.5Â°C global warming. As literature above 1.5Â°C is limited, feasibility at higher levels of warming may change, which is currently not possible to assess robustly. The term response is used here in addition to adaptation because some responses, such as migration, relocation and resettlement may or may not be considered to be adaptation. Migration, when voluntary, safe and orderly, allows reduction of risks to climatic and non-climatic stressors. Forest based adaptation includes sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, reforestation and afforestation. WASH refers to water, sanitation and hygiene. Six feasibility dimensions (economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical) were used to calculate the potential feasibility of climate responses and adaptation options, along with their synergies with mitigation. For potential feasibility and feasibility dimensions, the figure shows high, medium, or low feasibility. Synergies with mitigation are identified as high, medium, and low. The right hand side of panel (a) provides an overview of selected mitigation options and their estimated costs and potentials in 2030. Relative potentials and costs will vary by place, context and time and in the longer term compared to 2030. Costs are net lifetime discounted monetary costs of avoided greenhouse gas emissions calculated relative to a reference technology. The potential (horizontal axis) is the quantity of net GHG emission reduction that can be achieved by a given mitigation option relative to a specified emission baseline. Net GHG emission reductions are the sum of reduced emissions and/or enhanced sinks. The baseline used consists of current policy (around 2019) reference scenarios from the AR6 scenarios database (25/75 percentile values). The mitigation potentials are assessed independently for each option and are not necessarily additive. Health system mitigation options are included mostly in settlement and infrastructure (e.g., efficient healthcare buildings) and cannot be identified separately. Fuel switching in industry refers to switching to electricity, hydrogen, bioenergy and natural gas. The length of the solid bars represents the mitigation potential of an option. Potentials are broken down into cost categories, indicated by different colours (see legend). Only discounted lifetime monetary costs are considered. Where a gradual colour transition is shown, the breakdown of the potential into cost categories is not well known or depends heavily on factors such as geographical location, resource availability, and regional circumstances, and the colours indicate the range of estimates. The uncertainty in the total potential is typically 25â50%. When interpreting this figure, the following should be taken into account: (1) The mitigation potential is uncertain, as it will depend on the reference technology (and emissions) being displaced, the rate of new technology adoption, and several other factors; (2) Different options have different feasibilities beyond the cost aspects, which are not reflected in the figure; and (3) Costs for accommodating the integration of variable renewable energy sources in electricity systems are expected to be modest until 2030, and are not included.</p>
<p><strong>Panel (b)</strong> displays the indicative potential of demand-side mitigation options for 2050. Potentials are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions. The baseline (white bar) is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios (IEA-STEPS and IP_ModAct) consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. The green arrow represents the demand-side emissions reductions potentials. The range in potential is shown by a line connecting dots displaying the highest and the lowest potentials reported in the literature. Food shows demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use, and changes in land-use patterns enabled by change in food demand. Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, food) by 40â70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. The last row shows how demand-side mitigation options in other sectors can influence overall electricity demand. The dark grey bar shows the projected increase in electricity demand above the 2050 baseline due to increasing electrification in the other sectors. Based on a bottom-up assessment, this projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of infrastructure use and socio-cultural factors that influence electricity usage in industry, land transport, and buildings (green arrow).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4.5: Potential synergies and trade-offs between the portfolio of climate change mitigation and adaptation options and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</strong> This figure presents a high-level summary of potential synergies and trade-offs assessed in WGII Figure SPM.4b and WGIII Figure SPM.8, based on the qualitative and quantitative assessment of each individual mitigation or option. The SDGs serve as an analytical framework for the assessment of different sustainable development dimensions, which extend beyond the time frame of 2030 SDG targets. Synergies and trade-offs across all individual options within a sector/system are aggregated into sector/system potentials for the whole mitigation or adaptation portfolio.</p>
<p>The length of each bar represents the total number of mitigation or adaptation options under each system/sector. The number of adaptation and mitigation options vary across system/sector, and have been normalised to 100% so that bars are comparable across mitigation, adaptation, system/sector, and SDGs. Positive links shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b and WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of synergies, represented here by the blue proportion within the bars. Negative links shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b and WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to generate the percentage share of trade-offs and is represented by orange proportion within the bars. âBoth synergies and trade-offsâ shown in WGII Figure SPM 4b WGIII Figure SPM 8 are counted and aggregated to</p>
<p>âwhiteâ proportion within the bar indicates limited evidence/ no evidence/ not assessed.</p>
<p>Energy systems comprise all mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 and WGII Figure SPM.4b for adaptation. Urban and infrastructure comprises all mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under Urban systems, under Buildings and under Transport and adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Urban and infrastructure systems. Land system comprises mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under AFOLU and adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Land and ocean systems: forest-based adaptation, agroforestry, biodiversity management and ecosystem connectivity, improved cropland management, efficient livestock management, water use efficiency and water resource management. Ocean ecosystems comprises adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Land and ocean systems: coastal defence and hardening, integrated coastal zone management and sustainable aquaculture and fisheries. Society, livelihood and economies comprises adaptation options listed in WGII Figure SPM.4b under Cross-sectoral; Industry comprises all those mitigation options listed in WGIII Figure SPM.8 under Industry.</p>
<p>SDG 13 (Climate Action) is not listed because mitigation/ adaptation is being considered in terms of interaction with SDGs and not vice versa (SPM SR1.5 Figure SPM.4 caption). The bars denote the strength of the connection and do not consider the strength of the impact on the SDGs. The synergies and trade-offs differ depending on the context and the scale of implementation. Scale of implementation particularly matters when there is competition for scarce resources. For the sake of uniformity, we are not reporting the confidence levels because there is knowledge gap in adaptation option wise relation with SDGs and their confidence level which is evident from WGII fig SPM 4b.</p>

<p>2019 are shown. The grey bars show the minimum and maximum level of global annual mitigation investment needs in the assessed scenarios. This has been averaged until 2030. The multiplication factors show the ratio of global average early mitigation investment needs (averaged until 2030) and current yearly mitigation flows (averaged for 2017/18â2020). The lower multiplication factor refers to the lower end of the range of investment needs. The upper multiplication factor refers to the upper range of investment needs. Given the multiple sources and lack of harmonised methodologies, the data can be considered only if indicative of the size and pattern of investment needs.</p>
